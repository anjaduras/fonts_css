####### MY FIRST FONTS LIBRARY #######

Hi friends! So basically the idea of this was me trying to simplify my future work.

1. In html, there are (for now) 28 p tags with same text line and font name. I also give them all custom id-s to link them to css. 
2. CSS contains 28 @font-face methods where i made custom font-family names and linked the font files I downloaded earlier. 
3. Then I simply wrote a specific font-family for each id.

The problem I faced is that is seems like TTF fonts are a bit old now? 
Meaning they take much longer to load then web-fonts like Google ones. Still need th research what to do. Soo it`s definetely not the best way, still works though!
