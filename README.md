####### MY FIRST FONTS LIBRARY #######

Hi friends! So basically the idea of this was me trying to simplify my future work.

1. In html, there are (for now) 28 p tags with same text line and font name. I also give them all custom id-s to link them to css. 
2. CSS contains 28 @font-face methods where i made custom font-family names and linked the font files I downloaded earlier. 
3. Then I simply wrote a specific font-family for each id.
